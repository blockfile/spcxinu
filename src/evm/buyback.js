// quoting and venue dispatch exist ONLY for the buyback.
//
// The venue follows the launch's phase, exactly as the sweep does:
//
//   curve (pre-graduation)   curve.buy(quoteIn, minOut, us), quoted from reserves,
//                            funded by a plain ERC-20 allowance to the curve.
//   v4    (post-graduation)  UniversalRouter exact-in swap, quoted by V4Quoter,
//                            funded through Permit2.
//
// Amounts bought are measured from the wallet's balance DELTA rather than a
// return value, so a fee-on-transfer or rounding surprise cannot make the bot
// try to burn more than it actually received.
//
// The burn is a real `burn(uint256)` on the token — verified present on a live
// pons v2 launch — not a transfer to a dead address. It reduces totalSupply, so
// holders can watch the supply shrink on the explorer, and the burned tokens
// stop appearing in holder snapshots entirely.
