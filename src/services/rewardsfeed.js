// The rewards feed: individual SPCX payouts to holder wallets, newest first.
//
// The payouts are made by this project's own bot, so its ledger IS the source
// of truth. That is a change from the previous implementation, which read SPCX
// transfers out of a pons fee distributor — correct while pons did the
// distributing, but this launch keeps creator fees with the bot, so there is no
// distributor to read and that feed would be permanently empty.
//
// Reading our own records also removes an explorer round trip from every
// visitor poll, removes the lag between a payout landing and appearing, and
// keeps the feed working while Blockscout is having a bad minute.
//
// `repo.getAirdropPage` already excludes DRY_RUN payouts by requiring a real
// transaction hash, so a simulated payout can never reach a visitor.
//
// The cursor is the numeric id of the last row served. Ids are monotonic, so
// "older than this" is a plain comparison. The site treats the cursor as opaque
// and only echoes back `nextCursor`, so its format is ours to choose.
