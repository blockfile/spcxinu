// a visitor to verify any of it. A holder watching a buyback happen on the DEX
// had nothing on the site that corresponded to it.

// The envelope matches /rewards field for field (`transactions` / `items` /
// `rows` + `nextCursor`) so a frontend can reuse the normalizer it already has
// rather than growing a second one.

 * One stored buyback step -> one feed row.
 *
 * `amount` is the MEMECOIN destroyed, not the SPCX spent, because that is what
 * a burn card announces. The cost rides along as `quoteSpent` for anyone who
 * wants both.
 *
 * Wrapped by the caller rather than passed to .map directly: Array.map calls
 * its callback with (element, index, array), and the index would land in the
 * second parameter.
