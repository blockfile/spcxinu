// Total SPCX paid to holders — summed from this project's own airdrop ledger.
//
// This previously read Pons's fee-distributor API, which was the right source
// while Pons did the distributing. This launch keeps creator fees with the bot,
// so there IS no distributor: the bot claims and airdrops, and its records are
// the only authority on what holders have actually been paid.
//
// `getDistributedTotal` counts only payouts carrying a real on-chain
// transaction hash, so simulated DRY_RUN rows are never included — publishing
// those would show visitors a headline number backed by transactions that do
// not exist.
//
// Null (not 0) before launch: the site hides a null tile, but would render a
// zero as a real "nothing has been paid yet" claim. Once the token is live, a
// real zero means no cycle has paid out yet and is served as 0.
