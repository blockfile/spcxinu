// performing these burns, so its records are the authority, and only burns
// carrying a real on-chain transaction hash are counted — a DRY_RUN burn is
// recorded with a fabricated signature and must never reach a visitor.
//
// `quoteSpent` is what the burns actually COST, in SPCX. That is a different
// question from what the burned tokens are worth today, and both are served so
// the site can show either without doing arithmetic the backend already has the
// inputs for.
//
// Null (not 0) before launch: the site hides a null tile, but would render a
// zero as a real "nothing has been burned" claim. Once live, a real zero means
// no cycle has burned yet and is served as 0.
