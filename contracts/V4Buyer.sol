/**
 * Buy a token from a Uniswap v4 pool, talking to the PoolManager directly.
 *
 * The UniversalRouter cannot do this for a pons pool whose quote asset is an
 * ERC-20: SPCX -> SPACEINU reverts with empty data at every size, in both swap
 * directions, under every action ordering, with the wallet funded and Permit2
 * fully approved. The same router handles SPCX -> ETH on a hookless pool and
 * ETH -> memecoin on the same pons hook, so the failure is specific to
 * ERC-20-in + hooked-pool. The V4Quoter executes that exact swap — hook and all
 * — without complaint, which places the fault after the swap, in the router's
 * settlement, not in the pool.
 *
 * So this skips the router. Pull the input, unlock the PoolManager, swap,
 * settle what we owe, take what we are owed, and forward it. No allowances to
 * anything but this contract, no Permit2, no aggregator.
 *
 * No owner and no admin. It holds nothing between calls: every unit that comes
 * in is spent or returned inside the same transaction.
